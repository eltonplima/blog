My name is Elton Lima I'm a backend developer passionate about technology in a constant search of a better way to bring more value to my clients.

I'm a passionated Linux user and on my current work I play with [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [ELK](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack), [Celery](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/getting-started/introduction.html) and [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/), but I love other languages too, like: [Erlang](https://www.erlang.org/), [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

When I need to reinstall my machine I use my custom [Ansible playbook](https://github.com/eltonplima/configure-my-os-with-ansible) to install and configure all that I need. I love automation!
